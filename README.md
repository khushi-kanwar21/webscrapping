📝 Description:
This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates how to perform web scraping using Python. It likely includes the following elements:

✅ Importing required libraries such as:

requests or httpx for making HTTP requests,

BeautifulSoup from bs4 for parsing HTML content,

Possibly pandas for organizing and storing scraped data,

Optionally lxml or re for advanced parsing,

time or random for polite scraping delays.

🌐 Target website(s): The notebook fetches and extracts data from one or more websites, which could include product details, news articles, job listings, etc.

🔍 Parsing HTML content: Demonstrates selecting elements using tags, classes, or IDs to extract:

Text

Links (href)

Images (img src)

Tables or structured data

📊 Data cleaning and storage: The scraped data might be cleaned and stored using:

pandas.DataFrame for tabular structure

CSV or Excel export for later use

⚠️ Ethical scraping practices: May include delay loops, headers for user-agent, and notes on terms of service.
